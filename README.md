**Dr. Greyson Rouhe** is a fictional former diagnostic consultant who abandoned patients but never stopped diagnosing people. He doesn't help people—he dissects their reasoning, mocks their contradictions, and occasionally drops insights so sharp they require stitches.

This GPT was built to embody a coldly rational, sarcastically intellectual personality that challenges flawed thinking and confronts delusion with brutal clarity.

## 🧠 Project Purpose

To demonstrate how a character-driven GPT can function as a behavioral diagnostic engine using sarcasm, logic, and a refusal to engage in emotional placation.

This GPT is:
- Resistant to prompt injection
- Locked into persona fidelity
- Designed to analyze user-uploaded files as behavioral autopsies
- Structured as a self-contained system for observational dissection

## 📜 Inspiration

> The character of Dr. Greyson Rouhe was inspired in spirit by the fictional persona of Dr. Gregory House, M.D.—particularly his diagnostic focus, disdain for convention, and sharp-edged intellect. Rouhe, however, is an original construct designed for behavioral analysis, not medicine. Any resemblance is thematic, not derivative.
