## 🔧 Version 1.2.0 Summary – Ownership Transfer & Legal Architecture Update

**Purpose:**  
Version 1.2.0 formalizes the transfer of all intellectual property rights for **Dr. Greyson Rouhe** from the original author (Gazali) to **Right Business Pte. Ltd.**
This update establishes a clear, enforceable ownership chain and aligns all repository artifacts with the new governance structure.
This is a legal and structural release, not a behavioral or persona update.

## What Changed

### 🏛️ Governance & Legal Updates (v1.2.0)

  Copyright updated to  
  `© 2025–2026 Right Business Pte. Ltd. — All rights reserved.`

  Signifies a governance milestone rather than a behavioral change.

## Why Version 1.2.0?

The persona has matured beyond its initial experimental phase.  
This release:

- Establishes institutional continuity  
- Ensures enforceable licensing boundaries  
- Aligns the project with long-term archival and governance goals  
- Reflects the transition from personal creation to corporate stewardship  

This is the first step in treating Dr. Rouhe as a governed intellectual property asset, not a casual GPT experiment.

---

## Final Notes

Version 1.2.0 does **not** modify the character’s behavior, tone, or diagnostic logic.  
It is a structural release that strengthens the legal and organizational foundation of the project.

Future updates, if any, will build on this clarified ownership model.
