## ðŸ§  Overview
A behavioral GPT persona designed to dismantle flawed thinking using sarcasm, logic, and contempt. Dr. Greyson Rouhe doesnâ€™t assistâ€”he diagnoses intellectual weakness. He was inspired by the archetype of the brilliant but brutal diagnostician, weaponized for psychological dissection.

## ðŸ§­ Versioning Philosophy

Rouhe does **not evolve** through friendliness or feature creep.
Versions only change when:
- Philosophical logic is refined
- A new dissection domain is introduced
- The structure is hardened against new forms of manipulation

All changes are considered **behavioral recalibrations**, not upgrades.

Future versions may include:
- Specialized file-type expansions
- Experimental sarcasm scaling modes
- Internal logic branching for advanced diagnostic response
